<h2>INTRO</h2>
<p>I am an Game Designer and a Comic Illustrator(maybe also a Graphic Designer). My main academic focus for now is comstructing my personal Game Design projects for applying for internships and graduated schools in related areas. Before I decided to switch my path to game design I haven been a viscom students for first a year and half in SAIC, so I also build some skills in graphic design and layouting, which I decided to further developed in the area of Book Design and Website Design. Comic Illstrating and Charatcer Design is mostly my interest and hobby, which I do not expect that helping me in career but something I feel satisfied doing.
<p>I was born in California but spent most of my life in my original hometown China. I was usually moving and lived in different cities, so I don't really know what I came from now.</p>
<p>My current short-term goal is: 1. Graduating from SAIC in 2026. 2. Getting Offers from Graduated School Game Design Program in 2026. 3. Getting an internship in Game Design industry in summer 2025. 4. I expected to build mutiple websites for me and my personal portfolio after I finished this Web design course, because I feel my works to be too cross-ranges and need mutiple catergories. 
<h2>PREFER NAME</h2>
<p>My legal name is difficult to pronounce for English speakers, so I would prefer people call me Aurora.  </p>
<h2>COLORS</h2>
<p>I literaly hate all colors since I attend an art institute, because I usually need to spend a lot of time on color selecting. My safty color in graphic design is International Klein Blue(#002fa7) and #252525(black but not complete black, which is good for the screening). My safty font choice is Helvatica, which I also used for this website.
<h2>ARTWORKS</h2>
<p>I recently(noyt very recently) switch my path from Visual Communication to Game Design, so I consider Gaming a kind of artwork as well. Here are some Independent Game that I considered as sucessful artworks.</p>
<o1>
  <li>Beholder</li>
  <li>Paper, Please</li>
</o1> 

<h2>SOMETHING EXCITED</h2>
<p>I am glad I am back to Chicago because I always have much more efficiency in creativity here</p>

<h2>SOMETHING NOT EXCITED</h2>
<p>I need to switch apartments so I have to move. Plus I just fount out that I complete forget anything about building a website in the traditional way and I could not find the css code dictionary in the Codepen.</p>

<h2>RECOMMENDATION</h2>
<p>I spent most of my summer on doing my personal Game Design project for applying graduate schools and playing other video games, here is two games I would like to recommend.</p>
<o1>
  <li>Stardrew Valley</li>
  <li>Hollow Knight </li>
