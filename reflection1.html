<h2>Relationship With My Works</h2>
<p>
    In most cases, I have a personal philosophies that my works could be access in 4 degress: Functionality, Documentative, Happniess, and Self-Satisfied. 
    </p>
    <p>These accessments are varable, and could be used in the different stage of my works(some of my works could even be accessed completly differently with the stage difference). Functionality means it is a work that have a certain function, which I mostly do not consider as creative work, but only the way to achieve certain goal. For example, every essay I wrote for my liberal arts courses will have really high functionality, as well as all the coding part when I am doing the web projects or independent game. In this degree, I will neither feel proud or excited, and I will be really anxious about it, and of course feel like it lost its meaning if I do not finish it. 
</p>
<p>
    The second degree is Documentative, which means ambious works that I think will be important and helpful for my art or career path. Mostly I will be aware of certain work to be highly Ducumentative when I first start it(for example, the work I prepare for the portfolio for applying graduated schools), but some works will turn out to look good and its Ducumentative degree will raise. For this degree, I will defintly feel proud of finishing them, but not always excited because I will feel the most pressure of finishing them(so yes, I will be super anxious about them as well). I will not feel them to be unfinished to be completly not meaningful, but I will be very disappointing and hope that I could finish them one day.
</p>
<p>
    The third degree is Happniess, which is literaly the excitment and a way to release my pressure some times. I will feel proud, exciting and not anxious(because most of them do not have DDL at all) about these personal projects because I have no expectation on them. I feel meaningful for them to be either complete or not.
</p>
<p>
    The last degree is Self-Satisfied, which is the range that accesses if I am proud of that work or not. This degree is extremly varable for me and most of my works will have high Self-Satified at first and lost that at last.
